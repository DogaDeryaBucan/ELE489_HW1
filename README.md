# ELE489_HW1  
In this project, the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm was applied to the UCI Wine dataset. The goal was to classify wines into different classes based on several chemical properties, using different distance metrics. The distance metrics used were Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance. We evaluated the classifier's performance with various values of k (number of neighbors) and compared the results.
